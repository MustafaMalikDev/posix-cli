the fork problem:

when modifying a state or buffer from a forked process, it does not reflect on the parent process.
yes this is pretty obvious when working with children processes

proposal:
introduce piping system, you send a message through a pipe to update a buffer on the parent process.

problem:
this means a majority of the "ls" command needs to be refactored.
